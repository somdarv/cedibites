## [2026-04-04] Session: Settings Toggle Persistence, Delivery Fee Toggle & Global Operating Hours

### Intent

Fix a bug where admin settings toggles reset on page refresh despite being saved correctly. Add a delivery fee toggle so admins can control whether the checkout shows delivery fees. Add global operating hours editable from admin settings and displayed dynamically in the customer-facing footer.

### Changes Made

| File | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `app/admin/settings/page.tsx` | Added "Enable Delivery Fee" toggle in Order Settings tab | Admin control for delivery fee visibility in checkout |
| `app/admin/settings/page.tsx` | Connected General tab operating hours inputs to API (load from settings on mount, save on submit) | Previously these inputs had no backend connection — values were lost on refresh |
| `app/(customer)/checkout/page.tsx` | `OrderSummary` component now accepts `deliveryFeeEnabled` prop; delivery fee row conditionally rendered only when toggle is on | Checkout was showing "Delivery Fee: Free" even when delivery fees weren't intended |
| `app/components/layout/Footer.tsx` | Fetches `global_operating_hours_open` and `global_operating_hours_close` from `/checkout-config` endpoint | Previously used hardcoded "7:00 AM - 10:00 PM" values |
| `app/components/layout/Footer.tsx` | Added `formatTime12h()` helper for converting "HH:MM" to "H:MM AM/PM" display format | Hours stored as 24h strings in DB, need 12h format for display |

### Decisions

- **Decision**: Delivery fee toggle defaults to off
  - **Rationale**: Delivery fees were already "temporarily disabled" in the codebase; defaulting to off maintains current behavior
- **Decision**: Operating hours displayed as single "Daily" entry in footer
  - **Alternatives**: Could show per-day schedules
  - **Rationale**: Backend stores global hours (not per-day), so a single "Daily" row is accurate
- **Decision**: Footer fetches from public `/checkout-config` endpoint
  - **Alternatives**: Could use a dedicated `/operating-hours` endpoint
  - **Rationale**: `/checkout-config` already existed and now includes hours data; avoids an extra endpoint
- **Decision**: Service charge math confirmed correct (1% of ₵0.10 = ₵0.001 → rounds to ₵0.00)
  - **Rationale**: Mathematically correct, not a financial or code bug

### Cross-Repo Impact

| File (API repo) | Change | Impact on Frontend |
|-----------------|--------|--------------------|
| `app/Http/Controllers/Api/Admin/SystemSettingController.php` | `index()` now returns raw string values instead of cast values | **Fixes toggle persistence bug** — frontend `s.value === 'true'` comparisons now work correctly because API returns `"true"`/`"false"` strings instead of JSON booleans |
| `database/migrations/2026_04_04_072214_add_delivery_fee_and_operating_hours_settings.php` | Seeds `delivery_fee_enabled`, `global_operating_hours_open`, `global_operating_hours_close` | New settings available for frontend to read/write |
| `routes/public.php` | `/checkout-config` expanded with delivery fee and operating hours data | Frontend checkout and footer fetch from this endpoint |
| `routes/employee.php` | Settings allowlist expanded | Admin settings page can read/write the new settings |

### Current State

- **Admin Settings > Order Settings**: Service charge toggle + percentage + cap, manual entry date toggle, **new** delivery fee toggle — all persist correctly on refresh
- **Admin Settings > General**: Operating hours inputs now load from and save to the API
- **Checkout page**: Delivery fee row appears only when `delivery_fee_enabled` is `true`; service charge remains dynamic
- **Footer**: Operating hours displayed dynamically from API instead of hardcoded
- **Build**: Passes clean
- **Branch**: `payment-order-bug-fixes`

### Pending / Follow-up

- POS checkout flow may also need delivery fee toggle integration
- Per-branch operating hours UI if the feature is needed later
- Delivery fee amount/calculation logic when delivery fees are actually enabled

## [2026-04-04] Session: Order Audit & Security Bug Fixes

### Intent

A comprehensive audit of the order/payment/checkout pipeline was performed across both repos, identifying 7 bugs. All were fixed in this session on the `payment-order-bug-fixes` branch. Frontend changes focused on making the service charge calculation dynamic (fetched from API) and adding admin controls for the new service charge settings.

### Changes Made

| File | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `app/(customer)/checkout/page.tsx` | Added `ServiceChargeConfig` interface, `DEFAULT_SC_CONFIG` constant, and `calcServiceCharge(subtotal, config)` helper | Replace hardcoded 1% service charge with dynamic config from API |
| `app/(customer)/checkout/page.tsx` | Added `scConfig` state + `useEffect` fetching from `/checkout-config` public endpoint | Frontend needs real service charge config (enabled, percent, cap) before checkout |
| `app/(customer)/checkout/page.tsx` | Updated `OrderSummary` and `StepPayment` components to accept and use `scConfig` prop | Both components need access to service charge config for accurate display/calculation |
| `app/(customer)/checkout/page.tsx` | Service charge label now shows dynamic percentage: "Service Charge (1%)" | UX clarity — user sees the actual percentage being applied |
| `app/admin/settings/page.tsx` | Added `serviceChargeEnabled` (boolean toggle) and `serviceChargeCap` (text input) state variables | Admin needs controls for the two new system settings |
| `app/admin/settings/page.tsx` | Added loading of `service_charge_enabled` and `service_charge_cap` from admin settings API | Populate UI with current values on page load |
| `app/admin/settings/page.tsx` | Added saving of both new settings alongside existing `manual_entry_date_enabled` and `service_charge_percent` | Persist changes when admin saves settings |
| `app/admin/settings/page.tsx` | Replaced static Service Charge card with: enable/disable toggle, percentage input, cap (GHS) input with conditional rendering | Full admin control over service charge behavior |

### Decisions

- **Decision**: Fetch service charge config from a public `/checkout-config` endpoint
  - **Alternatives**: Could embed config in checkout session response or use authenticated endpoint
  - **Rationale**: Frontend needs service charge info before user is authenticated at checkout; public endpoint is simplest
- **Decision**: `calcServiceCharge()` helper applies percentage with cap logic client-side
  - **Rationale**: Matches the server-side calculation in `CheckoutSessionController::store()` — both use same percent + cap formula
- **Decision**: Conditional rendering for percentage/cap fields (only shown when service charge enabled)
  - **Rationale**: Reduces visual clutter when service charge is disabled

### Cross-Repo Impact

| File (API repo) | Change | Impact on Frontend |
|-----------------|--------|--------------------|
| `routes/public.php` | New `GET /checkout-config` endpoint | Frontend `useEffect` in checkout page fetches this |
| `app/Http/Controllers/Api/CheckoutSessionController.php` | Service charge now uses `service_charge_enabled`, `service_charge_percent`, `service_charge_cap` from SystemSettingService | Frontend calculation must match: `min(subtotal * percent / 100, cap)` |
| `app/Http/Requests/UpdateOrderStatusRequest.php` | Removed `pending`, `confirmed`, `cancelled` from allowed statuses | No frontend impact — frontend already uses correct status values |
| `app/Http/Controllers/Api/CheckoutSessionController.php` | Added branch authorization to `confirmCash()`/`confirmCard()` | No frontend impact — requests already scoped to correct branch |

### Current State

- **Checkout page**: Service charge is fully dynamic — fetches config from API, applies percentage with cap, displays accurate label
- **Admin settings**: Full service charge management — toggle on/off, set percentage, set cap (GHS)
- **Build**: Passes clean
- **Branch**: `payment-order-bug-fixes`

### Pending / Follow-up

- POS checkout flow may also need service charge config integration (currently separate flow)
- Consider caching `/checkout-config` response client-side to avoid re-fetching on every checkout visit

## [2026-04-04] Session: Metadata Page Titles Across All Pages

### Intent

Every page in the app should have a unique, descriptive browser tab title. Previously most pages showed a generic "CediBites" title, making it impossible to tell tabs apart. The root layout had a `%s | CediBites` template, but almost no pages filled in the `%s`. Customer-facing routes under `(customer)` had some metadata, but all staff/admin/kitchen/partner/POS pages had none.

### Changes Made

**8 `'use client'` layouts split into server + client pairs:**

| Original File (now `layout-client.tsx`) | New Server `layout.tsx`        | Metadata                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/admin/layout.tsx`                  | `app/admin/layout.tsx`         | Template: `%s — Admin \| CediBites`, default: "Admin", robots noindex        |
| `app/kitchen/layout.tsx`                | `app/kitchen/layout.tsx`       | Template: `%s — Kitchen \| CediBites`, default: "Kitchen", robots noindex    |
| `app/partner/layout.tsx`                | `app/partner/layout.tsx`       | Template: `%s — Partner \| CediBites`, default: "Partner", robots noindex    |
| `app/pos/layout.tsx`                    | `app/pos/layout.tsx`           | Template: `%s — POS \| CediBites`, default: "POS", robots noindex            |
| `app/pos/terminal/layout.tsx`           | `app/pos/terminal/layout.tsx`  | Title: "Terminal"                                                            |
| `app/staff/layout.tsx`                  | `app/staff/layout.tsx`         | Template: `%s — Staff \| CediBites`, default: "Staff Portal", robots noindex |
| `app/staff/partner/layout.tsx`          | `app/staff/partner/layout.tsx` | Template: `%s — Partner \| CediBites`, default: "Partner"                    |
| `app/order-manager/layout.tsx`          | `app/order-manager/layout.tsx` | Title: "Order Manager", robots noindex                                       |

**1 existing server layout updated:**

| File                          | Change                                                 | Reason                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/(staff-auth)/layout.tsx` | Added metadata export — title: "Staff", robots noindex | Was a server component already, just needed metadata |

**55+ new sub-page `layout.tsx` files created**, each exporting specific `Metadata` titles:

| Section       | Count | Pages                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin         | 14    | Dashboard, Orders, Branches, Menu, Configure Menu, Staff, Customers, Promos, Transactions, Analytics, Settings, Audit Log, Menu Add-ons, Menu Tags |
| Staff root    | 10    | Sign In, Forgot Password, Reset Password, Dashboard, Orders, Store, New Order, My Sales, My Shifts, Profile                                        |
| Staff/Manager | 12    | Manager Dashboard, Manager Orders, Analytics, Menu, Configure Menu, Menu Tags, Staff, Staff Sales, Shifts, My Shifts, Settings, New Order          |
| Staff/Partner | 5     | Dashboard, Orders, My Branch, Staff, Analytics                                                                                                     |
| Staff/Sales   | 5     | Sales Dashboard, Sales Orders, New Sales Order, My Sales, My Shifts                                                                                |
| Partner       | 5     | Dashboard, Orders, My Branch, Staff, Analytics                                                                                                     |
| Kitchen       | 1     | Kitchen Display                                                                                                                                    |
| POS           | 2     | Terminal, Orders                                                                                                                                   |
| Customer      | 4     | Payment Successful, Payment Cancelled, Checkout Return, Checkout Cancelled                                                                         |
| (Staff-auth)  | 1     | Change Password                                                                                                                                    |

### Decisions

- **Decision**: Layout-splitting pattern for `'use client'` layouts (rename to `layout-client.tsx` + create server `layout.tsx` wrapper)
  - **Alternatives**: Could have used `generateMetadata()` or other dynamic approaches
  - **Rationale**: Standard Next.js approach — metadata must be exported from server components; splitting keeps the client logic untouched
- **Decision**: Title templates at section level (e.g. `%s — Admin | CediBites`)
  - **Rationale**: Sub-page titles automatically get section context without repeating it in every file
- **Decision**: All internal/staff-facing sections get `robots: { index: false, follow: false }`
  - **Rationale**: These are private dashboards — search engines should not index them
- **Decision**: Sub-page layouts are minimal (metadata export + passthrough children)
  - **Rationale**: Only purpose is to set the title; no added complexity
- **Decision**: Customer payment result pages also get robots noindex
  - **Rationale**: Transient pages (success/cancelled) have no value in search results

### Current State

Every page in the app now has a unique, descriptive browser tab title. The title hierarchy is:

- **Root**: `CediBites — Authentic Ghanaian Food Delivery` (default) with template `%s | CediBites`
- **Section layouts**: Override with their own templates (e.g. `%s — Admin | CediBites`)
- **Sub-page layouts**: Set specific titles (e.g. "Dashboard", "Orders", "Analytics")
- **Result**: A page like Admin → Dashboard shows **"Dashboard — Admin | CediBites"** on the tab

Build verified clean (exit code 0).

### Cross-Repo Impact

None — this is a frontend-only change. No API changes needed.

### Pending / Follow-up

- Customer-facing route group `(customer)/` already had some metadata; could audit for consistency with the new pattern
- If new pages are added in the future, they should include a `layout.tsx` with metadata to maintain tab title coverage

## [2026-04-04] Session: Project Chronicle Agent Setup

### Intent

Create an institutional memory system for the CediBites project — a "Project Chronicle" agent that silently observes all changes across sessions, records them, and can brief developers and other agents on the current state of any part of the system.

### Changes Made

| File                                                      | Change                                        | Reason                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.github/agents/project-chronicle.agent.md`               | Created agent definition                      | New agent with read/search/edit/agent/todo tools, mandatory cross-referencing, structured chronicle format |
| `.github/instructions/chronicle-reminder.instructions.md` | Created instruction file with `applyTo: "**"` | Auto-reminds all agents to ask user about updating the chronicle after every code change                   |
| `PROJECT_CHRONICLE.md`                                    | Created knowledge base file                   | Seeded with system map (route groups, state management, API layer, utilities) as a hybrid starting point   |

### Cross-Repo Impact

| File (API repo)                                           | Change                              | Reason                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.github/agents/project-chronicle.agent.md`               | Mirror of frontend agent definition | Same agent available in both repos                                            |
| `.github/instructions/chronicle-reminder.instructions.md` | Mirror of frontend instruction      | Reminder works regardless of which repo is being edited                       |
| `PROJECT_CHRONICLE.md`                                    | API knowledge base file             | Seeded with system map (routes, models, services, architecture, integrations) |

### Decisions

- **Decision**: Hybrid approach — seed with system map, build change log incrementally
  - **Alternatives**: Full scan first vs. purely incremental
  - **Rationale**: Gives the agent useful context from day 1 without requiring a massive upfront audit
- **Decision**: Place agent + chronicle in both repos
  - **Rationale**: Agent needs to be discoverable from either workspace; chronicle files track repo-specific changes
- **Decision**: Mandatory cross-referencing between repos
  - **Rationale**: API and frontend are tightly coupled — changes in one often affect the other
- **Decision**: `applyTo: "**"` for the reminder instruction
  - **Rationale**: Should trigger after editing any file type, not just specific ones

### Current State

The Project Chronicle system is fully set up and operational:

- Agent definition in both repos (`.github/agents/project-chronicle.agent.md`)
- Auto-reminder instruction in both repos (`.github/instructions/chronicle-reminder.instructions.md`)
- Knowledge base files in both repo roots (`PROJECT_CHRONICLE.md`)
- System maps seeded; change log ready for entries

### Pending / Follow-up

- First real development session will test the reminder flow end-to-end
- Chronicle entries will accumulate as sessions happen
